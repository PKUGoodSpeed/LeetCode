##### Actual score:

### 121, Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
##### Questions: Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i. If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.
###### Idea: 
```
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        
    }
};
```

### 122, Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II
##### Questions: Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i. Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times). However, you may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).
###### Idea: 
```
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        
    }
};
```

### 123. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III
##### Questions: Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i. Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most two transactions.
###### Idea:
```
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        
    }
};
```

### 124. Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum
##### Questions: Given a binary tree, find the maximum path sum. For this problem, a path is defined as any sequence of nodes from some starting node to any node in the tree along the parent-child connections. The path must contain at least one node and does not need to go through the root.
###### Idea: 
```
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    int maxPathSum(TreeNode* root) {
        
    }
};
```

### 125. Valid Palindrome
##### Questions: Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.
###### For example,
###### ```A man, a plan, a canal: Panama``` is a palindrome.
###### ```race a car``` is not a palindrome.
###### Idea: dfs + dp;
```
class Solution {
    vector<int> dp;
    int nDec(string &s, int i){
        if(i==s.size()) return 1;
        if(i==s.size()-1) return s[s.size()-1] !='0';
        if(dp[i]>=0) return dp[i];
        int x = int(s[i]-'0'), y = int(s[i+1]-'0');
        return dp[i] = int(x!=0)*(nDec(s,i+1) + int(x*10+y<=26)*nDec(s,i+2));
    }
public:
    int numDecodings(string s) {
        if(s.empty()) return 0;
        dp = vector<int>(s.size(),-1);
        return nDec(s,0);
    }
};
```
