1. `SELECT`
    SELECT name, population, area FROM World WHERE area > 3000000 OR population > 25000000;
2. `UNION`
    SELECT name, population, area FROM World WHERE area > 3000000
    UNION
    SELECT name, population, area FROM World WHERE population > 25000000;

1. 开始一位是排好序的，所以想用错位，最后还是没搞出来：
    SELECT MIN(ABS(a.x - b.x)) AS shortest FROM point AS a, point AS b WHERE a.x != b.x;
2. Use `Self Join`:
    SELECT MIN(a.x - b.x) AS shortest FROM point as a JOIN point as b WHERE a.x > b.x;
## **627**
1. `CASE WHEN STATEMENT`
    UPDATE salary
    SET sex = (CASE WHEN sex = 'm' THEN 'f' ELSE 'm' END);
2. 数学方法：
    UPDATE salary
    SET sex = CHAR(ORD('f') + ORD('m') - ORD(sex));
## **584**
1. 为啥还要加上 `referee_id IS NULL`:
    SELECT name FROM customer WHERE referee_id IS NULL OR referee_id != 2;
## **586**
1. 非常笨的方法：
    SELECT g.customer_number FROM
    (SELECT COUNT(order_number) AS cnt, customer_number FROM orders GROUP BY customer_number) AS g WHERE g.cnt = 
    (SELECT MAX(f.cnt) FROM (SELECT COUNT(order_number) AS cnt FROM orders GROUP BY customer_number) AS f);
2. 标准答案还没老子的快：
    SELECT g.customer_number FROM
    (SELECT COUNT(order_number) AS cnt, customer_number FROM orders GROUP BY customer_number ORDER BY cnt DESC LIMIT 1) AS g;
## **620**
1. 我都能做出来的题：
    SELECT * FROM cinema WHERE id%2 AND description != 'boring' ORDER BY rating DESC;
## **610**
1. `IF` statement:
    SELECT x, y, z, IF (x+y>z AND x+z>y AND y+z>x, 'Yes', 'No') as triangle FROM triangle;
2. `CASE` statement:
    SELECT x, y, z, (CASE WHEN x+y>z AND x+z>y AND y+z>x THEN 'Yes' ELSE 'No' END) as triangle FROM triangle;
## **603**
1. 做道简单要花九牛二虎之力：
    SELECT a.seat_id AS seat_id FROM cinema AS a, cinema AS b WHERE a.seat_id = b.seat_id - 1 AND a.free AND b.free
    UNION
    SELECT a.seat_id AS seat_id FROM cinema AS a, cinema AS b WHERE a.seat_id = b.seat_id + 1 AND a.free AND b.free
    ORDER BY seat_id
## **577**
1. 我都可以做对的题：
    select name, bonus FROM
    (Employee LEFT JOIN Bonus ON Employee.empId = Bonus.empId) WHERE bonus IS NULL OR bonus < 1000;
## **607**
1. 才知道SQL 还有 `IS IN` 语句：
    SELECT name FROM salesperson WHERE sales_id NOT IN
    (SELECT sales_id FROM orders WHERE com_id IN (
    SELECT com_id FROM company WHERE name = 'RED'))
## **182**
1. 靠自己的力量做出来的：
    SELECT r.Email FROM
    (SELECT Email, COUNT(*) AS Cnt FROM Person GROUP BY Email) AS r WHERE r.Cnt > 1;
## **181**
1. 靠自己的力量做出来的：
    SELECT Name As Employee FROM
    Employee as e LEFT JOIN 
    (SELECT Id AS MId, Salary AS MSal FROM Employee) AS m ON e.ManagerId = m.MId
    WHERE Salary > MSal;
2. Only Use `SELECT`:
    SELECT Name AS Employee FROM Employee AS e WHERE Salary > (SELECT Salary FROM Employee WHERE Id = e.ManagerId);
## **183**
1. `IS IN` 语句，刚学：
    SELECT Name AS Customers FROM Customers WHERE Id NOT IN
    (SELECT CustomerId FROM Orders);
2. Use `JOIN`:
    SELECT Name AS Customers FROM
    (Customers LEFT JOIN (SELECT Id AS OrderId, CustomerId FROM Orders) AS o ON Customers.Id = o.CustomerId)
    WHERE OrderId IS NULL;
## **597**
1. 注意看题：没说只统计在`friend_request` 中出现的：
    SELECT (CASE WHEN g.d > 0 THEN ROUND(g.c/g.d, 2) ELSE 0.0 END) AS accept_rate FROM
    (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT a.requester_id, a.accepter_id) AS c, COUNT(DISTINCT b.sender_id, b.send_to_id) AS d FROM 
     request_accepted AS a, friend_request AS b) AS g;
## **619**
1. 独立完成！
    SELECT MAX(b.num) as num FROM
    (SELECT a.num FROM
     (SELECT num, COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM number GROUP BY num) AS a WHERE a.cnt = 1) AS b;
## **596**
1. 独立完成：
    SELECT a.class FROM
    (SELECT class, COUNT(DISTINCT student) AS cnt FROM courses GROUP BY class) AS a WHERE a.cnt >= 5;
2. 学到了一个 `HAVING` statement:
    SELECT class FROM courses
    GROUP BY class
    HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT(student))>=5
## **196**
1. 居然意外得做对了：
    DELETE FROM Person WHERE (Id, Email) NOT IN(
        SELECT a.Id, a.Email FROM(
            SELECT MIN(Id) AS Id, Email FROM Person GROUP BY Email) AS a);
## **197**
1. 如果不知道 `datediff` 函数，这题完全没法做：
    SELECT DISTINCT a.Id FROM Weather AS a, Weather AS b WHERE datediff(a.RecordDate, b.RecordDate) = 1 AND a.Temperature > b.Temperature;
2. USE `SELECT` and `TO_DAYS` 函数：
    SELECT t1.Id FROM Weather AS t1 INNER JOIN Weather AS t2 ON TO_DAYS(t1.RecordDate) = TO_DAYS(t2.RecordDate) + 1
    WHERE t1.Temperature > t2.Temperature
## **176**
1. 独立完成：
    SELECT (CASE WHEN (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Salary) FROM Employee) >=2 THEN a.Salary ELSE NULL END) AS SecondHighestSalary FROM
    (SELECT DISTINCT Salary FROM Employee ORDER BY Salary DESC LIMIT 2) AS a ORDER BY a.Salary LIMIT 1;
2. 高手解法：
    SELECT MAX(Salary) AS SecondHighestSalary FROM Employee WHERE Salary != (SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employee)
3. 下面这个不懂：
[ ] 到底是 Which Union Which???
    SELECT Salary AS SecondHighestSalary FROM Employee
    UNION
    SELECT NULL
    ORDER BY SecondHighestSalary DESC LIMIT 1,1
## **570**
1. 独立完成的第一个Medium：
    SELECT a.Name FROM
    Employee AS a INNER JOIN
    (SELECT ManagerId, COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM Employee GROUP BY ManagerId) AS b ON a.Id = b.ManagerId
    Where b.cnt >= 5;
2. Use `HAVING COUNT`:
    SELECT Name FROM Employee WHERE Id IN
    (SELECT ManagerId FROM Employee GROUP BY ManagerId HAVING COUNT(*) >= 5);
## **608**
1. 独立完成：
    SELECT id, 
    (CASE WHEN p_id IS NULL THEN 'Root' WHEN id IN (SELECT p_id FROM tree) THEN 'Inner' ELSE 'Leaf' END)
    AS type FROM tree ORDER BY id;
[ ] 为什么反过来 用 `NOT IN` 不work：
    SELECT id, 
    (CASE WHEN p_id IS NULL THEN 'Root' ELSE (CASE WHEN id NOT IN (SELECT p_id FROM tree) THEN 'Leaf' ELSE 'Inner' END) END)
    AS type FROM tree ORDER BY id;
2. 这个可以：
    SELECT id, 
    IF(p_id IS NULL, 'Root', IF(id NOT IN (SELECT p_id FROM tree WHERE p_id IS NOT NULL), 'Leaf', 'Inner')) AS type FROM tree ORDER BY id;
3. 用 `IF`:
    # Write your MySQL query statement below
    SELECT id, 
    IF(p_id IS NULL, 'Root', IF(id IN (SELECT p_id FROM tree), 'Inner', 'Leaf')) AS type FROM tree ORDER BY id;
## **612**
1. 独立完成：
    SELECT ROUND(MIN(c.r), 2) AS shortest FROM
    (SELECT SQRT((a.x-b.x)*(a.x-b.x) + (a.y-b.y)*(a.y-b.y)) AS r FROM point_2d AS a, point_2d AS b WHERE a.x != b.x OR a.y != b.y)
    AS c;
2. 用 `JOIN`:
    SELECT  MIN(   ROUND ( SQRT( POWER(L.X-R.X,2) + POWER(L.Y-R.Y,2) ), 2) ) AS  shortest FROM POINT_2D L
    JOIN POINT_2D R
    ON L.X != R.X OR L.Y != R.Y;
## **626**
1. 独立完成， Ugly Solution:
    SELECT x.id, IF(x.id%2=0 || x.id<(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM seat),
                    (SELECT student FROM seat WHERE id=x.id - 1 + 2*(x.id%2)), x.student)
    AS student FROM seat AS x ORDER BY x.id;
2. 自己研发的NB方法：
    SELECT a.id, b.student FROM seat AS a,
    (SELECT * FROM seat
    UNION ALL
    (SELECT (id+1) as id, student FROM seat ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 1)) as b
     WHERE b.id = a.id - 1 + 2*(a.id%2);
## **585**
1. 用了九牛二虎之力终于做出来了：
    SELECT ROUND(SUM(TIV_2016), 2) AS TIV_2016 FROM insurance WHERE
    TIV_2015 IN (SELECT TIV_2015 FROM insurance GROUP BY TIV_2015 HAVING COUNT(*) > 1) AND
    (LAT, LON) IN (SELECT LAT, LON FROM insurance GROUP BY LAT, LON HAVING COUNT(*) = 1);
## **602**
1. 这题真是莫名其妙：非要把`COUNT DISTINCT`去掉才过
    SELECT y.id, y.num FROM
    (SELECT x.id, COUNT(x.frd) AS num FROM
    (SELECT requester_id AS id, accepter_id AS frd FROM request_accepted
    UNION ALL
    SELECT accepter_id AS id, requester_id AS frd FROM request_accepted) AS x GROUP BY x.id)
    AS y ORDER BY y.num DESC LIMIT 1;
[ ] 这个反而错了：
    SELECT y.id, y.num FROM
    (SELECT x.id, COUNT(DISTINCT x.frd) AS num FROM
    (SELECT requester_id AS id, accepter_id AS frd FROM request_accepted
    UNION ALL
    SELECT accepter_id AS id, requester_id AS frd FROM request_accepted) AS x GROUP BY x.id)
    AS y ORDER BY y.num DESC LIMIT 1;
## **580**
1. 注意排序即可：
    SELECT z.dept_name, IF(z.cnt IS NULL, 0, z.cnt) AS student_number FROM
    (SELECT dept_name, cnt FROM (SELECT dept_id, COUNT(DISTINCT student_id) AS cnt FROM student GROUP BY dept_id) as x
    RIGHT JOIN department ON x.dept_id = department.dept_id) AS z ORDER BY z.cnt DESC, z.dept_name;
2. 更简洁：
    SELECT dept_name, COUNT(DISTINCT student_id) AS student_number FROM
    student RIGHT JOIN department ON student.dept_id = department.dept_id
    GROUP BY dept_name ORDER BY student_number DESC, dept_name;
## **574**
1. 题意很模糊，不仅要票数最多，二且要再`Candidate` Table 里：
    SELECT g.Name FROM
    (SELECT x.Name, COUNT(DISTINCT x.id) AS cnt FROM 
     (SELECT Vote.id AS id, Candidate.Name as Name FROM Vote LEFT JOIN Candidate ON Vote.CandidateId = Candidate.id)
     AS x GROUP BY x.Name ORDER BY cnt DESC LIMIT 1) AS g WHERE g.Name in (SELECT Name FROM Candidate);
## **578**
1. 题都没读懂，莫名其妙就过了。。。
    SELECT z.question_id AS survey_log FROM
    (SELECT x.question_id, (x.ans / y.shw) AS rate FROM
    ((SELECT a.question_id, COUNT(*) as ans FROM (SELECT question_id FROM survey_log WHERE action = 'answer')
    AS a GROUP BY a.question_id) AS x
    INNER JOIN
    (SELECT b.question_id, COUNT(*) as shw FROM (SELECT question_id FROM survey_log)
    AS b GROUP BY b.question_id) AS y
    ON x.question_id = y.question_id) ORDER BY rate DESC LIMIT 1) AS z;
2. 原来还能这么些：
    select question_id as survey_log
    from survey_log
    group by question_id
    order by count(answer_id)/count(*) desc
    limit 1
## **178**
1. 很简单：
    SELECT y.Score AS Score, (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT x.Score) FROM Scores AS x WHERE x.Score>y.Score) + 1 AS Rank
    FROM Scores AS y ORDER BY Rank;
2. 这个完全没懂

1. 太Easy：
    SELECT DISTINCT x.Num AS ConsecutiveNums FROM Logs AS x, Logs AS y, Logs As z
    WHERE x.Id = y.Id-1 AND x.Id = z.Id-2 AND x.Num = y.Num AND x.Num = z.Num;
2. Use `INNER JOIN`:
    SELECT DISTINCT x.Num AS ConsecutiveNums FROM
    Logs AS x INNER JOIN
    Logs AS y ON x.Id = y.Id + 1 AND x.Num = y.Num INNER JOIN
    Logs AS z ON x.Id = z.Id + 2 AND x.Num = z.Num;
## **184**
1. 非常笨的方法，用Salary的value做`JOIN`:
    SELECT x.Name AS Department, y.Name AS Employee, y.Salary AS Salary FROM
    (SELECT Department.Name AS Name, Department.Id AS Id, MAX(Salary) AS val FROM
    (Employee INNER JOIN Department ON Employee.DepartmentId = Department.Id) GROUP BY Department.Name)
    AS x LEFT JOIN Employee AS y ON x.val = y.Salary AND x.Id = y.DepartmentId;
2. 高手解法，利用比最大 Salary大的value的个数为0:
    select a.Name as Department,b. Name as Employee ,b.Salary from
    Department as a join 
    (select * from Employee e1 where(select count(*) from Employee e2 where e2.Salary>e1.Salary and e1.DepartmentId=e2.DepartmentId)<1) as b
    on  b.DepartmentId=a.Id
## **614**
1. 简单的 `GROUP BY` 语句：
    SELECT x.follower AS follower, COUNT(DISTINCT y.follower) AS num FROM
    follow AS x, follow AS y WHERE x.follower = y.followee GROUP BY x.follower;
## **177**
1. 居然tm 过了：第一次遇到定义函数
    CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT
    BEGIN
      DECLARE M INT;
      SET M = N-1;
      RETURN (
          # Write your MySQL query statement below.
          SELECT DISTINCT Salary FROM Employee ORDER BY Salary DESC LIMIT M,1
      );
    END
  - `CREATE FUNCTION FUNCTION_NAME(VAR TYPE) RETURN TYPE`
  - `BEGIN`
  - `DECLARE VARS TYPES;…`
  - `SET VARS = ?` (Initialization)
  - `RETURN(SELECT 语句)`
  - `END`
## **571**
1. 超时的解法：
    SELECT AVG(u.target) AS median FROM(
    SELECT MIN(w.num) AS target FROM
    (SELECT z.num, SUM(z.cnt) AS accu FROM
    (SELECT x.Number, y.Number AS num, (SELECT @total := SUM(Frequency) FROM Numbers), x.Frequency AS cnt FROM Numbers x, Numbers y WHERE x.Number <= y.Number)
    AS z GROUP BY z.num) AS w WHERE w.accu >= FLOOR((@total + 1)/2)
    UNION
    SELECT MIN(w.num) AS target FROM
    (SELECT z.num, SUM(z.cnt) AS accu FROM
    (SELECT x.Number, y.Number AS num, x.Frequency AS cnt FROM Numbers x, Numbers y WHERE x.Number <= y.Number)
    AS z GROUP BY z.num) AS w WHERE w.accu >= FLOOR((@total + 2)/2)) AS u;
2. 别人的解法：
    select avg(Number) median from(
        select Number, @prev := @count as prevCount, (@count := @count + Frequency) as curCount
        from Numbers, (select @prev:=0, @count:=0, @total:=(select sum(Frequency) from Numbers)) temp order by Number
    ) n1
    where n1.curCount >= floor((@total+1)/2)
    and @total-n1.prevCount >=  floor((@total+1)/2)

    (SELECT name FROM student where continent = 'Europe' ORDER BY name) AS s, (SELECT @crank := 0) AS r) AS c ON a.Id = c.Id

GET INDEX 用：

1. `SELECT @RANK`
    SELECT @rank := @rank + 1 AS Id, col FROM tablename, (SELECT @rank := 0) AS r
2. `ROW_NUMBER()`:

1. 靠自己的力量做出的第一道 Hard，虽然方法很笨：
    SELECT w.id, w.date, w.people FROM
    (
        SELECT x.id, x.date, x.people FROM stadium x, stadium y, stadium z WHERE
            x.id = y.id-1 AND x.id = z.id-2 AND x.people >= 100 AND y.people >= 100 AND z.people >= 100

    ) AS w ORDER BY w.id;
2. 这个好像更直接一些：
    select * from stadium s1
    where s1.people>=100 and 
    ((select count(*) from stadium s2 where s2.id in (s1.id+1,s1.id+2) and s2.people>=100)>=2
